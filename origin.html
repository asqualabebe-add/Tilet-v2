  <h2>Shemma/ Ethiopian cotton</h2>

<p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shemma</strong> is Ethiopian cotton and the production of it is Ethiopia’s oldest industry. Traditionally the cotton was hand spun and woven on handlooms. <br><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Handpicked cotton is separated and dyed to the desired color and then woven to create particular pieces. Although there are now quite a few designs which are machine manufactured, many of the designs on the finished garments are embroidered by hand and these still remain very popular.<br><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the Ethiopian cotton industry is quite large there are many Ethiopian designers and design companies who use this product in their fashions.</p>

	<h3>Women</h3>
	
	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Often, a woman will cover her head with a "shash", a cloth that is tied at the neck. Women's dresses are called "Habesha kemis", and are often made from the "shemma" cloth. The dresses are usually white with some color above the lower hem. Elderly women will wear a shash on a day-to-day basis, while other women only wear a shash also called a "Netela" while attending church. <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Netela (ነጠላ) is very thin and delicate, with the texture of gauze, with only two layers and is quite large. It is white with colorful intricately woven borders called <strong><i> Tilet </i></strong>. A variety of designer dinner dresses combining traditional fabric with modern style are now worn by some ladies in the cities.

	<h3>Men</h3>
	
	 <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Men wear pants and a knee-length shirt with a white collar, and perhaps a sweater. They also frequently wear knee-high socks. Both Men as well as women wear shawls, the Netela. <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shawls are worn in a different style for different occasions. When going to church, during funerals, the shawl is worn so the shiny threads appear at the bottom (madegdeg).
